What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing the repository sets up the space for the commits to be saved and organized.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a 'pre-loading dock' for the various files to be included in any given repository. It allows you to add all neccessary files before having to create a single commit.
