When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you'll be using different computers to edit your work, and when that work will be
shared amongst many different project participants.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to wait until you reached a complete version update. In other words, 
it might be better to wait until a series of commits that resulted in a significant,
logical overall change was in place before pulling them.
