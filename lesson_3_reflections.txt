When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you'll be using different computers to edit your work, and when that work will be shared amongst many different project participants.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to wait until you reached a complete version update. In other words, it might be better to wait until a series of commits that resulted in a significant, logical overall change was in place before pulling them.


Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You clone repositories when you want to make another repository on the same machine. Forks are a type of clone for when you want to take a repository from github in order to make changes to a repository and share those changes without actually changing the original. Branches are for taking a different evolutionary route of code, keeping the main code (master) seperate until an entire feature is complete.
